Overview
Welcome Home is a relational database system designed to support the Welcome Home project. This repository contains the schema design, data storage implementation, and related components to manage and organize data efficiently for the project.
Features

Relational Database Schema: Structured schema design to store and manage project-related data.
Data Storage: Efficient storage mechanisms for handling various data types and relationships.
Web Interface: A user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interacting with the database.
Backend Logic: Java-based backend to handle database operations and business logic.

Technologies Used

Java: 40.3% - Backend logic and database connectivity.
CSS: 20.6% - Styling for the web interface.
JavaScript: 19.6% - Frontend interactivity and dynamic features.

For the web interface, ensure a modern browser for HTML/CSS/JavaScript compatibility.


Run the Application:
Compile and run the Java backend (e.g., using Maven or Gradle, if applicable).
Open the HTML files in a browser or deploy the web application to a server.


Test the System:
Access the web interface and verify database connectivity.
Run sample queries or operations to ensure the system is functioning as expected.
