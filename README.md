## Technologies

- **Java (40.3%)**: Backend logic and database connectivity  
- **CSS (20.6%)**: Styling for the web interface  
- **JavaScript (19.6%)**: Frontend interactivity and dynamic features

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarshithaJ28/Welcome-Home.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd Welcome-Home
   ```

3. **Set up the database**

   * Install the required DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   * Import the schema from **schema.sql** (if available) or follow schema documentation.
   * Configure database settings in the Java application (e.g., `config.properties`).

4. **Install dependencies**

   * Ensure **Java JDK (X or higher)** is installed.
   * Use a modern browser for **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** compatibility.

5. **Run the application**

   * Compile and run the **Java backend** (e.g., using Maven or Gradle).
   * Open **HTML files** in a browser or deploy to a server.

6. **Test the system**

   * Access the **web interface** and verify database connectivity.
   * Run **sample queries** to ensure functionality.
